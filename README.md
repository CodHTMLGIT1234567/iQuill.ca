# iQuill.ca
Welcome to iQuill. We are committed to showcasing opinion and thought pieces discussing socially relevant themes and ideas which are present on screen.

iQuill exists for one reason only, which is to respond to the different voices and perspectives that say something interesting and unique about the society which we inhabit. One of the ways we do this is by recognizing and appreciating the true beauty of storytelling, and the power of the ideas which it can spread. In this blog, we will remark upon the strength of the themes and messages present in film, television, and books, and we will discuss the many thoughts that left behind long after the credits have rolled or the last page has been flipped. We also seek to comment on and discuss many current issues as they occur, and the 'Food For Thought' space on this blog has been created for this purpose.

This blog is currently at its beginning and we invite you to join us to become a part of this remarkable journey.
